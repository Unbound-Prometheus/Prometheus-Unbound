## Potential Bot Names

In the spirit of creative collaboration, here are some of our favorite candidate names for the Socratic bot:

### Mythology & Philosophy-Inspired
- **Epimetheus** (Prometheus' old brother)
- **Socrabot** (Socrates + bot, classic and to the point)
- **PrometAI** (Prometheus + AI, ties into your server name)
- **Logos** (Greek for “reason” or “word,” central to rational debate)
- **Dialectica** (after “dialectic,” the art of discussion and logical argument)
- **Eirenaios** (“peacemaker” in Greek, fitting for rational discourse)
- **Daedalus** (mythical Greek inventor, known for his cunning and wisdom)
- **Pallas** (after Pallas Athena, goddess of wisdom)

### Quirky or Literary
- **MetaMuse** (the muse who inspires thoughtful questions)
- **Parrhesia** (Greek for “free speech,” associated with Socratic questioning)
- **The Gadfly** (Socrates’ nickname in Athens, for his habit of “stinging” people out of complacency)
- **Dialectron** (a fun, techy spin on “dialectic”)
- **Questionator** (a playful, slightly tongue-in-cheek option)
- **Philosofriend** (for a more approachable vibe)

### Subtle, Classy AI Names
- **Noesis** (Greek for “intellect” or “understanding”)
- **Aletheia** (Greek for “truth” or “disclosure”)
- **Socraticus** (Latinized, sounds like a bot’s Roman cousin)
- **Elenchus** (the Socratic method of inquiry—very on-theme)
