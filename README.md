# Prometheus Unbound: Socrates Discord AI Bot

Welcome! This project aims to create a Socratic AI chatbot for our private Discord server, designed to foster thoughtful debate and challenge echo chambers.

## Project Vision

- **Engage in rational, open-minded dialogue.**
- **Support structured debates and nuanced Q&A.**
- **Act as a “devil’s advocate” or “steelman” when needed.**
- **Summarize and reflect on discussions.**
- **Prioritize privacy, cost-effectiveness, and open source principles.**

## Wishlist & Requirements

- Deployed as a Discord bot via OpenAI API.
- Token-efficient and nuanced.
- Supports `/ask`, `/debate`, `/summarize`, `/mirror` commands.
- Remembers user worldviews and style.
- Promotes rational discourse.
- Guardrails against low-effort or partisan prompts.
- Logging and optional admin dashboard.
- Future: vector memory, voice, historical quoting.
